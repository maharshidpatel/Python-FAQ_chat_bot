The recommendation system employs TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for vectorization, converting articles into numerical representations that highlight word importance. It then calculates cosine similarity to measure content similarity between articles.

This system spots and removes duplicate articles (with a similarity score of 1.0) from the recommendations, even if they are listed multiple times in the CSV file. This ensures that users receive diverse and relevant suggestions.
