PHASE 2:

When no specific intent is matched, the bot activates fallback strategies to interpret and respond effectively:

    Detecting Questions and Commands: The bot recognizes whether you're asking a question or giving a command, then adjusts its tone and response accordingly.

    Noun Chunk Extraction: For statements, the bot identifies key noun phrases to craft a more relevant response based on your topic or object of interest.

    Location-Based Queries: Mention any place or landmark, and the bot may provide a Google Maps link to assist with directions.

    People and Organizations: If you inquire about known individuals or companies, the bot may offer a Google search link or Wikipedia link to help you learn more.

Here are some sample utterances to explore the bot's fallback capabilities:

Detecting Questions and Commands:

    "Can you help me find a new phone?" (Question)
    "Show me the latest deals!" (Command)

Noun Chunk Extraction:

    "I’m interested in the Photography." (Statement with a specific topic)
    "Tell me about the newest trends." (Statement about trends)

Location-Based Queries:

    "Where is the nearest Starbucks?"
    "How do I get to Central Park?"

People and Organizations:

    "Who is Elon Musk?"
    "Tell me about Microsoft."
